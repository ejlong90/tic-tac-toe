# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a  Tic Tac Toe game built in html, css and Javascript. 

This project was built for learning purposes. 

## How to Play

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
- Click on a cell to place your mark (X or O).
- The game ends when one player gets three in a row, or the board is full.

## Features

- Alternating turns between player X and player O.
- Check for a winner after each move.
- Simple user interface.


## Future Improvements - **Hard Mode with Minimax Algorithm**: I plan to implement a more challenging version of the game using the Minimax algorithm, making the computer player much harder to beat.
